* **[Verification System](https://github.com/zachdoug24/DBM-Raw-Data/tree/master/Verification%20System)** - This allows a user to get a code issued to them that they must verify in the appropriate channel, as well as makes sure that the only things that can be said in the appropriate channel are by the bot.
